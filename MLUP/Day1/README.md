# Day 1 session

Gabriel Rodrigues Palma introduced a Python basics course aimed at machine learning, covering foundational concepts in Python. He emphasised using Google Colab for coding and referenced the book "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz. The course will cover variables, data types, and decision-making in code using if-elif-else structures and loops. Practical examples included insect classification, habitat suitability analysis, and data collection. Gabriel highlighted the importance of logical operators, debugging techniques, and break and continue statements in loops. The session concluded with a summary and a reminder of the afternoon session's focus on Python applications. Here is a 8 minutes summary of the content covered this day:

Action Items
- [ ] Explore Google Colab and the provided code examples.
- [ ] Practice the Python syntax fundamentals covered in the morning session.
- [ ] Experiment with making decisions in code using if-elif-else statements.
- [ ] Implement loop structures and control mechanisms in Python.

# Google Colab

Google Colab provides a browser-based environment for writing and executing Python code without local setup. Start by visiting [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), signing in with a Google account, and creating a new notebook via **File > New Notebook**. Write code in cells (e.g., `print("Hello World")`) and execute it by clicking the play button or pressing **Ctrl+Enter**. Notebooks autosave to Google Drive, and you can rename files by clicking the default title or share them via the **Share** button. For structured workflows, use **+Code** or **+Text** buttons to add cells, and rearrange them using the arrow icons[1][2][5][7].

The summary was generated using the live transcription of the morning sessions' content with the help of [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/).

## Introduction to Python Basics Course
- Gabriel Rodrigues Palma introduces the Python basics course, emphasising its importance in machine learning using Python.
- The course aims to cover foundational concepts in Python, including initial steps, programming language basics, and loops.
- Gabriel shares his journey with Python, starting in 2017, and how it has been instrumental in his statistics and machine learning career.
- The course will be conducted using Google Colab, allowing participants to code together without pre-installing Python.

## Using Google Colab and Recommended Books
- Gabriel explains the benefits of using Google Colab, including using different GPUs and avoiding pre-installations.
The course will focus on Mark Lutz's book "Learning Python".
- Gabriel highlights the importance of having a comprehensive book like "Learning Python" for reference and consultation.
- The course will use a combination of code in presentations and hands-on applications in Google Colab.

## Python Syntax Fundamentals
- Gabriel introduces Python syntax fundamentals, including variables, strings, integers, floats, and Booleans.
- He explains the importance of case sensitivity in variable names and the use of quotation marks to denote strings.
- Gabriel demonstrates how to print variables using the print function and the F-string format.
- The session includes examples of basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## Making Decisions in Code
- Gabriel discusses the importance of making decisions in code, using if, elif, and else structures.
He shares his experience in applied biology and taxonomy, where binary trees and classification keys were used to classify insects.
- Gabriel provides examples of decision-making in code, including habitat suitability analysis for mountain gorillas.
- The session includes practical examples of using logical operators like and, or, and not to combine multiple conditions.

## Power of Repetition: Loops
- Gabriel introduces the concept of loops, specifically the for loop and the while loop, for repetitive tasks.
- He explains the for loop for sequential iterations and the while loop for conditional iterations.
- Gabriel provides examples of using loops for data collection and analysis, including temperature and humidity measurements.
- The session includes practical examples of using continue and break statements to control loop iterations.

## Hands-On Exercises and Course Structure
- Gabriel emphasises the importance of hands-on exercises and practical applications in learning Python.
- He outlines the structure of the course, including morning sessions focused on Python basics and afternoon sessions on specific applications.
- Gabriel encourages participants to ask questions and engage actively in the course.
- The session concludes with a summary of the key points covered and an invitation to the afternoon session.

# The key concepts you need to know to follow up with the afternoon session are:
1. Python syntax fundamentals:  
- Understanding variables and data types (strings, integers, floats, Booleans)  
- Performing basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus)  
- Printing variables using the print function and F-strings

2. Making decisions in code:  
- Using if-elif-else statements to make decisions based on conditions  
- Combining multiple conditions using logical operators (and, or, not)  
- Applying decision-making concepts to real-world examples like habitat suitability analysis

3. Power of repetition: loops  
- Implementing loops for sequential iterations  
- Using while loops for conditional iterations  
- Controlling loop behaviour with continue and break statements  
- Applying loops to practical scenarios like data collection and analysis

The morning session covered these foundational concepts in Python, and understanding them will be crucial for following along and actively participating in the afternoon session, which will focus on specific applications and more advanced topics. I recommend following the action items and the exercises to get the foundation practice needed for our first afternoon session.
